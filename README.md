College Student Placement Analysis ðŸŽ“
Project Summary
This project analyzes a college student dataset to find the key factors that drive job placement. It explores how CGPA, internships, and projects impact success, starting with an unclean dataset and producing a cleaned, analysis-ready version.

Analysis Workflow
The project followed a standard data science workflow:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent text.

Feature Engineering: Created a Project_Rank_in_CGPA feature to measure a student's initiative relative to their academic peers.

EDA & Visualization: Used various plots (bar charts, line plots, heatmaps) to uncover insights and answer key business questions.

Setup & Technologies
Tech Stack: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

To Run: Clone the repository, install dependencies from requirements.txt, and run the primary analysis scriptÂ orÂ notebook.
